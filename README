Transcendence Leaderboard 1.0 
================================

A leaderboard designed for the game Transcendence (http://transcendence-game.com),
making use of the Stats Sumbmission system added into versions after 1.01. It is 
open source and quite easy to use. It makes use of a combination of PHP and Python.
The database it uses is SQLite and should work on most systems. 

To enable stat submissipon within the game set this:
> <Services>
> 	<Xelerus enable="true"
>	host="stats.transcendence.mostlynothing.info"
>	postStatsURL="input.php
>	/>
> </Services>

Let me know of any new charts and issues you might find.
